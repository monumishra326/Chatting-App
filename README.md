 ## Sockets
    
   Having an active connection opened between the client and the server so client can send and receive data. This allows             real-time communication using TCP sockets. This is made possible by Socket.io.

   The client starts by connecting to the server through a socket(maybe also assigned to a specific namespace). Once connections is successful, client and server can emit and listen to events.
